### Description 


- Defining Position, velocity, X and Y coordinates in moveBall function helps the ball to bounce on the page.

- setInterval calls the moveBall() every 100ms and this creates movement.

- Finally, edge detection prevents the ball from bouncing out. 


### To Run this Program

In order to run this file, Fork and Clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in a browser.


### Future RoadMap

This project can be still be enhanced by 

- changing color of the ball every time it bounces.

- increasing velocity every time it bounces.
